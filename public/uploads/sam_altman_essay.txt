Altman joined Y Combinator (YC) in 2011 as a part-time partner, and in 2014, he was appointed as president by Paul Graham, YC’s co-founder. During his tenure, Altman expanded YC’s influence by:

Scaling the accelerator – He increased the number of startups funded and broadened YC’s focus beyond software to include hard tech, biotech, and AI startups.
